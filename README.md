# bis-terminal

This repo documents "best in slot" (BIS) replacements for common command line utilities, most of which are from the [POSIX command list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_POSIX_commands).

To be eligible, the BIS alternative must be a drop-in replacement for the original, or close. It doesn't need to have feature parity, but it shouldn't feel like a completely new utility either â€“ anyone familiar with the original should be able to use its basic functionality with little-to-no learning curve.
